WLPressBot is a news aggregator for IRC, its function is to periodically
search within a list of feeds for news that includes a specified term, which
is determined in the config.xml. The bot will then publish results in a
channel (which is given as an entry parameter). 
Currently it is being used by WikiLeaks Press to send notification of any
publication related to WikiLeaks.
